= Collaborative policy playgrounds

Cerbos Hub playgrounds are fully-interactive, private development environments that provide an IDE-like experience for authoring policies. You can quickly create or edit policies and test fixtures with instant feedback on syntax issues and test failures. Drag and drop policy files, test files, or zip archives from your local machine directly into the playground editor for fast loading and testing. Take advantage of the powerful collaborative editing features to pair with colleagues to develop new authorization rules or use it as a sandbox to train new team members on Cerbos policies.

== Creating a playground

Login to Cerbos Hub and select one of the organizations you're a member of. Click on the **Playgrounds** tab to view existing playgrounds or to create a new one.

When creating a new playground, you have a number of options:

* Create an empty playground to start from scratch
* Generate a starter RBAC policy by answering a few questions about your user roles, resources and actions
* Start with an example template set of policies covering common use cases


After creating a playground, click on the **Video tutorial** button on the top right corner of the screen to learn the basics.

== Playground engine settings


The playground engine settings in the Settings tab allow you to configure the xref:cerbos:configuration:engine.adoc[Cerbos PDP engine] used when evaluating policy during development. Policy execution traces are available, providing a detailed, step-by-step view of how Cerbos evaluates a request, including every rule, condition, and variable evaluation. This helps you debug complex authorization logic and understand exactly why a specific decision was made.

- **Default policy version**: When a request does not explicitly specify the policy version, the Cerbos engine attempts to find a matching policy that has its version set to `default`. You can change this fallback value by setting the default policy version.

- **Lenient scope search**: When lenient scope search is enabled, if a policy with scope `a.b.c` does not exist in the store, Cerbos will attempt to find scopes `a.b`, `a` and ```` in that order.

- **Globals**: Global variables are a way to pass environment-specific information to policy conditions. Values defined here are exposed to policy conditions via the `globals` object.

You can find full details of these settings in the xref:cerbos:configuration:engine.adoc[Cerbos configuration reference].

== Explore tab

The Explore tab lets you interactively test authorization decisions against your policies. Select a fixtures folder containing test data, then choose a principal and resource to evaluate.

The panel displays:

* **Actions and effects**: Each action shows its authorization result (`ALLOW` or `DENY`). Click **Trace** next to any action to see the detailed evaluation path.
* **Effective derived roles**: Shows which derived roles were activated for the selected principal, helping you understand role-based access decisions.

Click **+ Add action** to test additional actions, or **Create auxiliary data fixtures** to add test data for your evaluations.

== Test results

The bottom panel shows test execution results with two tabs:

* **Problems**: Displays any syntax errors or validation issues in your policies.
* **Test results**: Shows the outcome of all policy tests. Filter by **Passed**, **Failed**, **Skipped**, or **Errored** to focus on specific results.

Click on any test file to see detailed results. For failed tests, a side-by-side diff view highlights the differences between expected and actual outputs.

== Execution traces

When debugging complex authorization logic, execution traces provide a detailed, step-by-step view of how Cerbos evaluates a request. Traces show every rule, condition, and variable evaluation, helping you understand exactly why a specific decision was made.

To view execution traces, click the **Trace** button next to any action in the Explore tab. Expand individual trace entries to see the evaluation path, including which rules matched and how conditions were evaluated.

== Try the API

One of the key features of the playground is the ability to try out authorization checks against your policies without having to run a local Policy Decision Point (PDP). In the Implement tab of the sidebar, you can experiment with both the Check API and the Plan API. This section allows you to select from your test fixtures and view the request structure needed to call the PDP, as well as the expected response. When evaluating policies, the effective derived roles for a user are displayed, helping you understand which derived roles were activated for that user during the request.

== Connect a PDP to a playground

For developers looking to test the integration of their application, Cerbos Hub offers a Playground PDP connection. This feature allows you to start up a PDP locally in your development environment and connect it to your current playground instance. Any changes you make in the playground are immediately reflected in your local PDP, enabling fast iteration and providing a real-time feedback loop for your integration efforts.

Instructions for starting up a local PDP can be found in the Implement tab under "Connect a PDP"

IMPORTANT: Note that while the Playground PDP connection is an excellent tool for rapid development and testing, it's not intended for production use. When you're ready to release your application to production environments, you should xref:getting-started.adoc[create a workspace] with a policy store and configure the PDPs to receive bundle updates via Cerbos Hub's fully managed CI/CD pipeline. It also allows you to take advantage of Cerbos Hub audit log collection to effortlessly store and analyze all the decisions made by your PDPs.
