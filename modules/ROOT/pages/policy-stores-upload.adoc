= Policy stores: Browser Upload

The browser upload feature allows you to manually upload policy files directly to a policy store using the Cerbos Hub web interface. This is useful for when you want to quickly add policies without using a Git repository or CI/CD pipeline.

== Uploading Policies

To upload policies using the browser, follow these steps:

1. Go to the https://hub.cerbos.dev[Cerbos Hub] and log in with your Cerbos account.
2. Inside a workspace, create a new policy store by clicking on "Policy Stores" in the sidebar.
3. In the Import tab, select "Browser upload" as the source for your policy store.
4. Click on the "Upload files" button to select a ZIP file of your policies or drag and drop the ZIP file into the designated area.
5. Once the file is uploaded, the policies will be processed and added to the policy store.
6. You can then view and manage the uploaded policies in the policy store Policies tab.

NOTE: Uploading policies via the browser does a full replace of the existing policies in the store. If you want to append or update specific policies, consider using a Git repository or CI/CD pipeline instead.
