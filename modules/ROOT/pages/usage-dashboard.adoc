= Usage dashboard

The Usage Dashboard provides comprehensive, real-time observability into your authorization service, allowing you to monitor key metrics, analyze trends, and get insights into how your policies are being used across your organization.

== Overview
The Usage Dashboard is accessible from two locations:

* The workspace homepage - provides a quick reference overview
* The dedicated "Usage" section - offers detailed metrics and historical data

== Key metrics

The dashboard surfaces several critical metrics to help you monitor your authorization layer:

=== Monthly Active Principals (MAPs)
Track the number of unique principals (users, services, or applications) interacting with your authorization policies each month. This metric helps you:

* Understand user adoption and growth
* Identify unexpected usage patterns
* Plan for capacity requirements

=== Check API calls
Monitor the volume and outcomes of Check API calls with a clear breakdown of:

* Allowed: Successful authorization decisions
* Denied: Rejected authorization attempts

A sudden spike in denied calls could indicate:

* Policy changes that restrict access
* Misconfigured policies
* Application bugs  


=== Plan API calls
Analyze Plan API calls that generate dynamic queries, showing:

* Allowed: Full access granted
* Denied: No access permitted
* Conditional: Partial access with constraints

This breakdown is crucial for understanding policies that dynamically generate database queries and conditional access patterns.

== Usage details table
Below the visualization widgets, the "Usage details" table provides granular, month-by-month metrics including:

[cols="1,3"]
