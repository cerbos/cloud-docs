= Policy Decision Point - Embedded

Cerbos Hub generates an embeddable version of policies - powered by WebAssembly - enabling authorization decision to be made on device, at edge or other environments where it is not possible to run a service. These bundles are generated through the CI/CD pipeline and are kept in sync with your policies on every change. These modules can be loaded into client applications via the Cerbos SDKs and handle authorization cehcks without the need to roundtrip to the backend service. Use cases such as showing and hiding UI elements on a webpage can be done all locally using the data avaliable in the page but still using the policies being served by the service instances.
