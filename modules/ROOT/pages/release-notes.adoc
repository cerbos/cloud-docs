=== Create playground from a store
You can now create a playground directly from an existing policy store, making it easy to experiment with production policies in a safe, isolated environment. This feature streamlines the workflow for testing policy changes before deploying them, allowing you to iterate quickly without affecting live authorization decisions. You can also use a store's policies as a starting point for developing new authorization rules, reducing the time needed to build and validate complex policy structures.

=== Test case output diff view
When a test case fails, you can now view a side-by-side diff comparing the expected output with the actual output. This visual comparison makes it significantly easier to identify exactly what went wrong—whether it's a missing permission, an unexpected denial, or an incorrect output value. By highlighting the specific differences, you can quickly understand the root cause and fix failing tests with confidence.

=== Execution traces in playground explore tab
Execution traces are now available directly in the playground's explore tab, providing real-time visibility into how Cerbos evaluates your authorization requests. As you experiment with different principals, resources, and actions, you can inspect the complete policy evaluation path to understand exactly how decisions are made. This makes it easier to debug complex policy logic and verify that your authorization rules behave as expected before deploying them.

=== Accessibility improvements
Icon-only buttons throughout the interface now have proper accessibility labels, ensuring screen reader users can navigate and interact with all controls effectively. Additionally, identifiers such as policy names, resource kinds, and action names are now displayed using a fixed-width font, improving readability and making it easier to scan lists of technical values.

== 2025-11-06

=== Combobox input improvements
Fixed an issue with combobox components when using multiselect and free-input modes together. This resolves problems that could occur when selecting multiple values while also entering custom text, ensuring a smoother form input experience throughout the Hub interface.

== 2025-10-27

=== Store import wizard fix
Fixed an issue that prevented the store import wizard from completing successfully in certain scenarios. The wizard now reliably guides you through importing policies from external sources, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience when migrating existing authorization rules into Cerbos Hub.

== 2025-10-21

=== Expired invitation handling
The system now properly handles expired invitations, displaying clear messages when users attempt to accept an invitation that is no longer valid. This prevents confusion and guides users to request a new invitation from their organization administrator, streamlining the team onboarding process.

== 2025-10-08

=== Workspace name validation
Workspace names now require a minimum length, with immediate validation feedback in the creation form. This prevents issues that could arise from very short or ambiguous workspace names, helping teams maintain clear and consistent naming conventions across their organization.

=== Invitation management improvements
Improved handling when inviting users who are already members of an organization. The system now prevents duplicate invitations and provides clearer error messages explaining why an invitation cannot be sent. This reduces confusion for administrators managing team access and ensures invitation workflows remain straightforward.

=== Build status fix
Fixed an issue where the wrong build status was displayed in the UI for certain policy stores. Build indicators now accurately reflect the current state of your policy compilation, giving you reliable feedback on whether your latest changes have been successfully processed.

== 2025-09-09

=== Playground drag-and-drop support
You can now drag-and-drop policy and test files from your local machine directly into the playground editor. This makes it easier to quickly load and test local policy files without needing to copy and paste.

== 2025-09-01

=== Policy execution traces
Debugging complex authorization logic is now easier with policy execution traces. This feature provides a detailed, step-by-step view of how Cerbos evaluates a request, showing every rule, condition, and variable evaluation. Traces are available in the playground for real-time testing and in your deployment builds to provide production-level visibility, helping you quickly pinpoint why a specific decision was made.

=== Organization usage dashboard
A new organization-level usage dashboard is now available, aggregating authorization metrics from all your workspaces into a single view. This dashboard provides a complete picture of request volumes, policy distribution, and usage trends across your entire organization. It helps platform owners and engineering leaders understand adoption patterns, identify which teams might need support, and discover optimization opportunities.

== 2025-08-04

=== Usage dashboard
The new xref:cerbos:usage-dashboard.adoc[Usage Dashboard] provides comprehensive observability into your authorization service. It allows you to monitor key metrics, view trends, and gain insights into how your Cerbos Hub workspace is utililzed.

=== API key lifecycle
Should an API become blocked due to misconfiguration, you can now unblock it directly from the API key list. 

== 2025-07-17

A major launch of the xref:cerbos:policy-stores.adoc[Policy Stores] feature in Cerbos Hub, which allows you to store and manage your authorization policies more effectively. You can read more in the announcement blog post: https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/updated-cerbos-hub-complete-authorization-solution-for-your-identity-fabrics[Updated Cerbos Hub, the complete authorization solution for your Identity Fabric
,window=_blank].


== 2025-04-28

=== Organization deletion
You can now delete an organization in Cerbos Hub. To delete an organization, navigate to the organization settings page and click on the "Delete organization" button. Please note that this action is irreversible and will permanently delete all data associated with the organization.

== 2025-03-12

=== Playground
The effective derived roles for a user are now displayed in the playground when evaluating policies. This feature helps you understand which derived roles were activated for that user during that request.


=== Embedded Policy Decision Point
Time-based functions used in condition expressions such as `getHours` and `getMinutes` default to UTC unless the time zone is explicitly provided as an argument to the function. It's recommended to review your policies to make sure that time calculations use the correct time zone. Refer to xref:cerbos:policies:conditions.adoc#_timestamps[timestamps documentation] to identify the affected functions.


== 2025-02-26

=== Embedded Policy Decision Point

We’ve introduced support for capturing audit decision logs from the Cerbos Hub Embedded Policy Decision Points (ePDP) using the latest version of the https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos-sdk-javascript[Cerbos Javascript SDK]. This feature enables organizations to track and analyze authorization decisions made locally in embedded environments, ensuring complete visibility and auditability, without relying on a centralized PDP or Cerbos Hub.


== 2025-02-01

The Builds section of Cerbos Hub has been renamed Policies. The Policies section now includes all the features previously available in Builds, such as policy versioning, policy history, and policy deployment. The Builds section has been removed from the Cerbos Hub navigation.

== 2025-01-28

=== Playground
Added support for xref:cerbos:configuration:engine.adoc#_globals[globals] in playground engine settings. Global variables defined in the xref:playground.adoc[playground settings] are exposed to policy conditions via the `globals` object.
