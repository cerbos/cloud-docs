== Builds aren't triggered when multiple tags are pushed to the repository

GitHub has a link:https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#push[known limitation]  where connected apps like Cerbos Hub won't receive notifications for repository changes if more than three tags are pushed simultaneously. To avoid encountering this issue, we suggest setting the limit on maximum number of references to be pushed at once to three. You can find information on how to do this in the link:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-push-policy-for-your-repository#limiting-how-many-branches-and-tags-can-be-updated-in-a-single-push[GitHub documentation]
