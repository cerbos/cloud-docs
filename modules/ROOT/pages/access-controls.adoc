= Access controls

A Cerbos Hub user can have a role at the organization level and an optional set of roles for each workspace. All of these roles are considered when determining the permissions for any particular user.

== Organization roles

Organization roles, except for the `Member` role, apply to all workspaces within the organization. Users with organizational role of `Member` must be explicitly granted workspace roles in order to access a workspace.

== Workspace Roles

Permissions assigned at the organization level are inherited by all workspaces. Additionally, a user can be assigned specific roles within a workspace, potentially granting more permissions for that particular workspace only.
